# NYC_Citibike_Analysis


## Overview

Citibike analysis using rider data. Here is a [link to the data set used for this project "201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip."](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html "link to NYC Citi bike data titled 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip") Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then Tableau was used to create visualizations to draw insight into our customer base.

## Summary

Most of our customers are male subscribers. The average birthday for our customer is 1971, so the average age is 48, calculated from 2019. The average trip duration is 10.95 minutes. Both males and females ride bikes at 8 AM and 5 PM - 6 PM during the weekday. On weekends customers choose to ride bikes, mostly on Saturdays and throughout the day, starting at 10 AM and ending at 7 PM. 

I would also create two other visualizations. The first would be a map of activity showing where subscribers vs. customers are riding bikes. The second visualization would be a map of activity showing where males vs. females are riding bikes.
